== The context
* imagine I have two httpd apps
** one named app1
** one named app2
* since they are both based on the same techno (httpd, to make it simple and slim..)
* I want to define three roles
** httpd (the common infra)
** app1 (specific for app1, running on httpd)
** app2 (specific for app2, running on httpd)
* So, of course, I want machines for app1 & app2 share a common role : httpd

== the problem
* If app1 is deployed on host1
* If app2 is deployed on host2
** Then I have no problem
* Problem comes from (for example, on dev environments..)
** when app1 & app2 are installed on the same host
* then, the same host (commonhost) will have the same variable (say httpd_port) defined from two roles:
** role1
** rol2
* ansible won't let me choose to "only run role1" for common host (or role2, if that matters)



== Notes
* we define at least 3 ansible roles
** one for infrastructure (httpd)
** two for two different apps
*** similar in which they are based on the same infra (httpd)
*** but have different roles, configuration, files.. etc
*** and the most important one : one different apache_http_port for both role
** This leads to unpredictable executions
*** for example {{ app2 }} will inherit of {{ apache_http_port }} of role1 :-/
* to show this
** on prod
*** host1 will run app1
*** host2 will run app2
*** so, there should be no problem
** but on dev
*** app1 & app2 will be installed on commonhost (and there will be a problem)

== problem

== current solution
* hardcode the vars files passed to the playbook run
